## INIM: Inertial Images Construction with Applications to Activity Recognition 
This repository provides a framework for smartphone location and human activity recognition, based on the smartphoneâ€™s inertial sensors. This work proposes a novel time series encoding approach, from inertial signals to inertial images, and transfer learning from computer vision domain to the inertial sensors classification problem.
